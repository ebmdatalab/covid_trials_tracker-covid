The group will allow members to receive information and contribute to weekly conversations on pre-specified topics related to physical activity eg. sedentary behaviour, goal setting, benefits of physical activity and support. Different topics will be covered each week with 2-3 Facebook posts on the topic each week. The content of each topic is designed specifically for this study but will also make use of existing videos, pictures and information sources. An exercise physiologists and dietitian will deliver the program. The purpose of the Facebook group is to facilitate social support and provide participants with a platform to exchange personal experiences including barriers and facilitators to commencing and maintaining a physical activity program. While discussion topics will be pre-determined, discussion will change weekly based on the participants posts for example someone may ask for examples of workouts or different ways overcome barriers. Participants will also be able to join a group video call via zoom two times per week. These calls will last for 20-30mins. The facilitator will lead the call and provide education on the topic for the week. This will also give the facilitator the chance to check in on participants and allow them to ask questions. The intervention itself will go for 6 weeks however there is the option for participants to remain in the Facebook group and continue to use it for support without the input from the facilitators.

The Decathlon mask will be applied by clinicians in the hospital setting.<br>The mask is worn over the entire face and has advantages over conventional delivery methods in that it is thought to reduce the risk of virus aerosolization (a common problem with conventional delivery systems) and therefore increase safety for healthcare workers and other patients at the hospital.<br>We will test mask comfort and tolerability with daily questionnaires.<br>The mask will be applied to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during transfer between the emergency department and other locations such as radiology department, ward and high dependency unit.<br>We anticipate the mask will be worn for several hours at a time depending on patient tolerability (early data from overseas suggests superior tolerability to conventional mask setups).  The mask may be used intermittently for the entire patient admission to hospital pending the clinical needs and preference of the patient. We anticipate, based on how conventional treatments are applied, that the patient will use the mask in 3 hour sessions with potential breaks in between to be determined by clinical need and patient tolerability.",,,

Based on this structure a questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire contains items that are only given once (e.g. items relating to the beginning of the pandemic) and items that can be given weekly. This questionnaire was checked for comprehensibility by 3 - 5 family doctors. The recruitment of the participants is carried out via the email distribution list of professional associations and existing family doctor research and teaching networks. The survey is conducted via the open source online tool LimeSurvey. Persons who have agreed to participate in a weekly survey in the first survey will be contacted weekly. Since each participant chooses a code that only he/she knows, it is possible to summarize the surveys belonging to one person longitudinally, but it is not possible to assign these answers to a specific person. This guarantees the anonymity of the respondents. <br>Evaluation: The questionnaire is evaluated descriptively. Primarily, the extent of existing deficiencies and problems is to be recognized. Therefore, the items are evaluated individually and no summary of the items is planned. For this reason, the answers are displayed in frequencies. In order to obtain a conclusion on the population, 95% confidence intervals are calculated for the frequencies. Possible group differences (e.g. ordination in the country vs. ordination in the city) are analysed exploratively by means of chi-square methods. The sample size results from the e-mail addresses available in the distribution lists.",,,

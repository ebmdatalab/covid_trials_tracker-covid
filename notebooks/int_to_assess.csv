This is an initial confirmation of eligibility. Volunteers will initially be invited for a screening visit. Prior to attending they will have received written information about the study and had time to consider it. At the screening visit, a doctor will explain about the study and answer any questions they may have. If the volunteer decides to take part, they will be asked to sign a consent form. The doctor will then check whether the volunteer is eligible to take part. This will involve taking a medical history, performing a physical examination, taking blood tests, urine tests, and measuring blood pressure and temperature.<br><br>                The doctor will then write to the volunteer's own GP to enquire about their medical health. If all the inclusion criteria are met and none of the exclusion criteria are present then the volunteer is invited to return for vaccination. Due to the need for rapid delivery of this study, there will be minimal flexibility around appointment dates.<br><br>                Before vaccination, volunteers will be asked about their recent health to ensure that they are still medically fit.

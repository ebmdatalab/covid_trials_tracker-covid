The app uses short videos and interactive activities to allow participants to practice the coping strategies that are taught in each module (e.g. a relaxation technique). Participants are asked to complete one module per day and to complete the modules in one week. Each module takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. Participants will be asked to complete module 1 first, but the other modules can be completed in any order. Adherence will be assessed via app analytics and also using self-report.",,,

This non-invasive device provides a physical barrier to droplet and aerosol spread, as well as utilising a ventilation system to reduce aerosol spread from COVID-19 or other infectious diseases.  The hood has a skirt that drapes down the sides of the bed and over the patients waist and does not seal around the patient. The hood relies upon air being drawn up the sides of the bed and from the front near the patient‚Äôs legs etc. up to the rear, i.e. away from the healthcare worker who is principally at the front/sides of the patient. The air passes through the fan and on through a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, thereafter returning to the hospital air environment.  The device will be used continuously for 7 days or until the patient has been declared COVID-19 negative, is discharged from hospital, or elects to withdraw from the study.  Use of the device is entirely voluntary, and patients may elect to cease use of the device at any time either temporarily, or permanently.  Staff will be asked to complete simple data for each clinical shift about device compliance use.  In addition, measures to capture technical product adverse events and complaints will be captured by forms available to clinical staff and checked daily by the investigator team.  Technical product complaint data will be submitted to an independent data safety monitor team.",,,

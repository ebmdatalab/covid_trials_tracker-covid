It was adapted from HeadGear, an existing smartphone application designed for individuals working in male-dominated industries. Anchored is more broadly aimed at all adults, and has a more gender-neutral look and feel, achieved through use of colour scheme, imagery, font/typography, inclusion of male and female ‚Äòcharacters‚Äô, and delivery of in-app content by both male and female presenters. The Anchored app is designed for self-directed use by an individual on a smartphone device. It features interactive content, delivered by on-screen text, audio, static and interactive image displays and videos. The app can be accessed by the participant on their smartphone at a time and location of their choosing. This app/intervention has been used previously in a pilot study: Pilot-testing of a mobile phone application to support the mental health of Australian workers (ACTRN12619000761167) and is being currently being evaluated in a large scale randomised controlled trial (ACTRN12620000178943). Due to the unexpected changes to the workforce brought about by COVID-19 (coronavirus) the present study seeks to evaluate the efficacy of the Anchored app in individuals who are unemployed as a consequence of COVID-19. <br><br>The main therapeutic component of the Anchored app takes the form of a 30 day intervention in which users complete one ‚Äòchallenge‚Äô daily (5- 10 minutes per day). These 'challenges' feature a variety of evidence-based therapeutic techniques delivered using a range of formats including: psychoeducational videos (on coping skills and resilience, mindfulness, and behavioural activation) min",,,

The form can be used at triage or at full patient assessment, and will form part of the clinical record. It can also be used by the emergency department to guide triage assessment. For example, the data recorded can be used to recommend diversion away from the hospital if criteria are not met or admission to hospital if criteria are met. The form will include key variables used in recommended triage methods, such as PMEWS and the swine flu hospital pathway, and other variables considered to be potentially useful predictors of adverse outcome. We will allow participating sites to adapt the form to their local circumstances, for example omitting variables that are already routinely collected.<br><br>                The electronic and/or paper forms can also be used by paramedics in participating ambulance services.

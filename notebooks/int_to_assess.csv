Each module consists of 5 topics with short psychoeducative videos and written materials, while quizzes, worksheets, and feedback forms are included for increasing engagement. Parents can flexibly go through the topics during two weeks, requiring a 15-30-minutes daily online activity.<br><br>                To explore the optimal structure of the training, participants will be randomized into three conditions.<br>                In group 1., parents complete the online training program without having any contact with other participants or the clinician who follows their completion. The clinician contacts a parent only in case of emergency.<br>                In group 2., an online forum will be added to the structure of the training, where participants can share their experiences and contact each other, and ask the clinician. The clinician will be involved in the forum and answer the questions.<br>                In group 3., in addition to this, the clinician will give personal feedback to assignments submitted by the participants.<br><br>                Block randomization with randomly selected block sizes of 6, 12 is used.

The study will be multicenter. Adult ICU patients with serious/life-threatening COVID-19 receiving standard empiric therapies as per institutional and international protocols such as available antiviral treatments, hydroxychloroquine, mechanical (ARDS-net and prone position) ventilation,  fluid resuscitation, vasoactive substances, antibiotics amongst other usual ICU supportive therapies will be randomised to control or TPE groups. Those in the control group will receive usual care. Those in the TPE group will receive usual care plus TPE therapy.<br><br>                Randomization of the aforementioned groups will be done as follows. Eligible consented patients will be randomized after their stratification by ICU center and two PaO2/FIO2 ratio categories (>150 and <=150). Randomization will occur in variable block sizes of 4 to 8 patients. The researchers will utilize a web-based randomization service (randomize.net) to allocate patients to their respective strata prior to the intervention or control therapy. Given the nature of the TPE technology, the intervention will be unblinded (open label) hence, no enrollment concealment will be expedited. However, the lack of allocation concealment will be mitigated as much as possible by the following measures.

The interim trial results will be monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The DMC will assess whether the randomised comparisons in the study have provided evidence on mortality that is strong enough (with a range of uncertainty around the results that is narrow enough) to affect national and global treatment strategies. In such a circumstance, the DMC will inform the Trial Steering Committee who will make the results available to the public and amend the trial arms accordingly. New trial arms can be added as evidence emerges that other candidate therapeutics should be evaluated.<br><br>                Eligible patients are randomly allocated between several treatment arms, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital: No additional treatment vs Lopinavir-Ritonavir vs Interferon 1√ü vs Low-dose Corticosteroids vs Hydroxychloroquine.<br>                For patients for whom not all the trial arms are appropriate or at locations where not all are available, randomisation will be between fewer arms.<br><br>                Drug dosage and duration:<br>                Lopinavir 400 mg + ritonavir 100 mg: by mouth (or nasogastric tube) every 12 hours for 10 days or unti",,,

Participants will receive their usual management and information will be collected subsequently, detailing their treatment and outcomes. Research participants will not be contacted directly and no personally identifiable information (names, addresses or dates of birth will be collected.<br><br>                Cohort identification:<br>                Infected women will be identified through the UKOSS network of nominated reporting clinicians in each consultant-led maternity unit in the UK. Nominated reporting clinicians will be asked to report all pregnant women with confirmed pandemic novel coronavirus infection admitted to their unit. In view of the need for rapid and ongoing data analysis and production of guidance, we will use a specific web-based rapid reporting and data collection system for this study to enable UKOSS nominated clinicians to report cases as they occur. In addition, nominated clinicians will be sent a standard UKOSS reporting card each month to further enhance case ascertainment.<br><br>                Comparison group identification:<br>                Information about comparison women will be obtained from previously conducted UKOSS studies. Previous UKOSS studies have collected detailed demographic, pregnancy and delivery information about a cohort of over 1200 women giving birth in the UK identified from the same hospitals as infected women. This pragmatic approach has been adopted to allow risk factors for severe outcomes of pandemic influenza or novel coronavirus to be identified while minimizing the data collection burden on",,,

The intervention components are: identifying patient goals with therapist (1:1) and participation in virtual groups (up to 4 participants per session) with physiotherapist and occupational therapists which focus on increasing participation in life roles and usual activities. <br>The 1:1 session will last for approximately 45 minutes and will be followed by commencement of group sessions within 5 days.<br>Groups adopt a coaching model where the therapist talks about common challenges, facilitates discussion and sharing of experiences and ideas and the group brainstorm and plan next steps together.

875,ACTRN12620000447954,Use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to optimise oral/enteral hydroxychloroquine dosing in critically ill patients with COVID-19,"Based on preclinical and non-randomised studies, the Royal Brisbane and Women‚Äôs Hospital Intensive Care Unit clinical Consultant Medical Staff, in agreement with the Infectious Diseases Department and the Pharmacy Department, have decided that all patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 infection should receive hydroxychloroquine as standard care. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine is NOT considered a trial intervention for the purpose of this study.<br><br>The dose of hydroxychloroquine used for COVID-19 infection is extrapolated from that in common use for malaria and other approved indications. However, the organ dysfuction that accompanies critical illness suggests dosing is likely to require adjustment. This study will adjust the dose of hydroxychloroquine using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to a goal concentration known to be safe. The observation period for TDM will be a total of up to 10 days or until the time of ICU discharge, which ever is sooner.<br><br>As is routine practice at the RBWH ICU, TDM will be led by the senior ICU pharmacist after initiation of therapy. Trough venous blood samples (3 ml) will be taken via an indwelling arterial cannula. The first TDM should ideally occur before the administration of the FIRST MAINTENANCE DOSE, provided the appropriate loading dose schedule has been completed. Sampling thereafter can occur every 24-48 hours to confirm the appropriateness of ongoing dosing as guided by the Pharmacy and Medical Team. Blood samples will be transported to Queensland Pathology on the Herston Campus for drug analysis. Prescribing of initial and ongoing/revised dosing will remain the responsibility of medical officers, whilst fidelity of the intervention will be maintained through pharmacy dosing adjustment notes which are subjected to ",,,

Recruited patients will have an 18F-FDG PET/CT scan which will be assessed for persistent areas of increased inflammation in their lung tissue and for inflammation of blood vessels, indicated by measuring the amount of FDG seen in the aorta.

This will include information for children (use of parts relating to children will be facilitated by adult participants only), adolescents (use of parts relating to adolescents will be facilitated by adult participants only), and adults (including older adults), and include simplified CBT coping strategies as well as a comprehensive resource list of the many internet-based CBT programs, websites, and self-help books available as e-books to help people recognize and address different types of unhelpful thought patterns and behaviours which may contribute to heightened anxiety and depression during the pandemic. Coping strategies included in the guide include: <br>- Taking action to protect yourself against COVID-19 by following expert guidelines (COVID-19 specific)<br>- Engage in general self-care (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Engage in pleasant events (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Ways to deal with worry and rumination (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Ways to deal with anxiety over your health (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Ways to deal with anxiety over your finances (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Engage in problem solving (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Relaxation Exercises (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Mindfulness (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Exercise (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Challenge unhelpful thoughts with thought records (non-COVD-19 specific)<br>- Challenging unhelpful thoughts with behavioural experiments (non-COVD-19 specific)<br><br>All participants will be provided with an online information and consent form outlining what ",,,

We will recruit healthcare workers and other staff working in a facility where there are cases of either proven, or suspected COVID-19, who can be followed reliably for 5 months.<br><br>                The participant will be randomised to receive either chloroquine or placebo (1:1 randomisation), or to hydroxychloroquine or placebo (1:1 randomisation). A loading dose of 10 mg base/kg (between three and five tablets e.g., four 155-mg tablets for a 60-kg subject), followed by 155 mg daily (250 mg chloroquine phosphate salt/200 mg hydroxychloroquine sulphate) will be taken for 3 months.<br><br>                A randomisation list will be prepared by a statistician using block randomisation in a 1:1 ratio for the chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine arm versus the placebo and stratified by site. The randomisation will be computer-generated and programmed in Stata 15.<br>",,,

Participants in the intervention group will be required to interact with a digital companion daily for at least 15 minutes per day over a one-week period. The digital companion will be a digital human, which is an animated, embodied conversational agent that uses artificial intelligence to provide social and emotional engagement. The interaction will involve completing two ‘resilience’ module with a digital companion. One module includes the following loneliness intervention techniques: increasing social support, increasing opportunity for social interaction, and increasing social skills. For example, participants will be encouraged to contact someone from their existing social network. A second 'resilience' module includes techniques for reducing loneliness-related distress such as psychoeducation about coping skills and a deep breathing exercise. Participants will be required to participate in at least one resilience module activity per day and then they will have the choice to complete other activities with the digital companion. Some of the other activities participants can do with the digital companion include finding out information about mental health resources and COVID-19. Participants will give a minimum of 1 hour 45 minutes total time to the study over a one week period (at least 15 minutes of daily interaction plus completion of two 15-minute questionnaires). Participation will be completely remote and online, and participants will take part individually from their place of residence.

One adult woman per household was enrolled for the program. Following enrolment, we randomly assigned them to either the telecounseling treatment arm, Arm 1, or to the control arm, Arm 2, where no counseling is provided to women. Therefore, our randomization is at the household (or individual) level. <br>Eventually, 1,299 women were assigned to Arm 1 and 1,103 women to Arm 2. We are running four fortnightly (every two weeks) tele-counseling sessions, each for 20 minutes, covering different aspects of the coronavirus’ impact on women’s physical and emotional wellbeing. Thus, the intervention will be given over two months. The four informational modules (delivered via interactive sessions using study-specific materials) that are being covered are on: (i) awareness of COVID-19, symptoms and preventive measures to address the fear of infection (ii) taking care of emotional wellbeing to cope with stress (iii) taking care of physical health of self and child to address health-related anxiety and, (iv) helping each other and staying connected to cope with social distancing. <br>Sessions are delivered by locally recruited, trained female para counsellors.

Across sessions the clinical psychologist will teach the following stress coping strategies: anxiety reduction, problem solving, mood improvement strategies, worry management, and accessing social support. This will occur will via educational sessions, group discussions via teleconference, and app-based homework assignments. Homework will include mood monitoring, prompts to engage in positive activities, prompts to engage in social interaction, and prompts to limit worry time. App analytic data will measure adherence to homework tasks.

This drug is a product that combines these two existing products (Bromelain and Acetylcysteine), along with 5% glucose to be delivered into the nose via spray bottle delivery. The dose of the nose spray will vary based on dose escalation with Bromelain 25, 50, 75 and 100ug/ml. The dose of Acetylcysteine will be 10mg/ml. Doses will be increased after every 10 patients with the first patient receiving dose level 2 (50ug Bromelain) if safe based on the number of dose limiting toxicities. Cohorts will commence one week apart. The nose spray will be administered four times per day for five days. The participant will be asked to electronically log administration of the drug and any symptoms or side effects. In addition, the patient will be assessed for symptoms and side effects on daily follow up phone calls as well as preliminary evidence of efficacy with daily RT-PCR for viral load.",,,

4598,DRKS00022790,Risk prEdiction of indoor SporTs And cultuRe events for the Transmission of COVID-19,"Intervention 1: The centerpiece of the study is the creation of a mathematical risk model based on which the effects of large indoor events with 4000 participants on the number of new infections with COVID-19 should be simulated in a region.<br>In the first step, a scenario is to be modeled using the ""conventional"" (i.e. as was common before the pandemic) schedule of such an event (TP 1). To adjust this model, various individual aspects of transmission (aerosol-related transmission, droplet infection and smear infections) must be simulated in individual models or tests. For the aerosol-related transmission, an analysis of the indoor climate and the ventilation system is made, based on which the aerosol spread and concentration can be calculated (TP 3). For the other two transmission channels (droplet and smear infections), a major event is first analyzed using fire protection simulations for potential risk areas for crowds (TP 2) and then simulated with 4000 test subjects (TP 5). The intensity and duration of the contacts are measured using contact tracing devices and the risk areas for smear infections are determined using fluorescence techniques. Based on the results of the simulations, optimized process concepts are developed (TP 4) and then also reproduced with test subjects. The aim is to determine how the number of critical contacts or critical aerosol exposures can be reduced through such optimized concepts. In a second step, the model created in TP1 is adapted based on the data from the simulations and the experiments, and the effectiveness of optimized strategies on regional epidemiology is calculated (TP 7). Also, the influence of a contact tracing process is examined (TP 6). Finally, from the knowledge and data of the simulations and models, framework conditions",,,

The aim of nasal lavage and gargling is to reduce asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers, and thus reduce onward transmission to vulnerable care home residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The nasal rinse and gargling uses saline of approximately 3% salinity up both nostrils and then gargled from a 60 mL Gallipot. The study is a feasibility and pilot study. Outcomes in intervention care homes will be compared to control care homes that will not be advising their staff to perform nasal lavage and gargling.  <br>Each intervention care home will be provided with adequate supplies of Gallipots, salt, stirrers and information leaflets and posters to display to staff.  <br>Training will be provided remotely, prior to the start of the study, by means of both online videos (made available via private links) and written materials.  These materials have been designed specifically for the purposes of this study.  They are not available publically, to avoid the potential for methodological contamination of the study design. Care home staff will be asked to watch the videos once, but will be able to watch the videos as often as they wish for the duration of the study. <br>The study will last 12 weeks from the date the first care home starts.  Care homes will start in a phased way, determined by recruitment, and no care home will undertake the intervention for less than 8 weeks. <br>During the study, staff attendance at training sessions, and subsequent adherence/fidelity to HSNIG will be recorded and captured by responses to weekly surveys completed both by care home manag",,,
